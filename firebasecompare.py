write a python code to run on local system to pull requrest from sql mongo db or csv from firebase and do ocr on the image and compare it with other databse with same as pul it and apply ocr if its mathing tell matching so write a code 

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example Python code that demonstrates how to pull data from a SQL database or Firebase CSV file, perform OCR on an image, and compare it with a database to find matches:

python
Copy code
import pyodbc
import pymongo
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# SQL Server Connection Details
sql_server = '<SQL_SERVER_NAME>'
database = '<DATABASE_NAME>'
username = '<USERNAME>'
password = '<PASSWORD>'

# MongoDB Connection Details
mongo_uri = '<MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI>'
mongo_database = '<MONGODB_DATABASE>'
mongo_collection = '<MONGODB_COLLECTION>'

# Firebase Service Account Details
firebase_credentials = '<PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>'
firebase_collection = '<FIREBASE_COLLECTION_NAME>'

# Set up Firebase credentials
cred = credentials.Certificate(firebase_credentials)
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
firebase_db = firestore.client()

# Connect to SQL Server
sql_connection = pyodbc.connect(f"DRIVER={{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}};"
                                 f"SERVER={sql_server};"
                                 f"DATABASE={database};"
                                 f"UID={username};"
                                 f"PWD={password}")

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_uri)
mongo_db = mongo_client[mongo_database]
mongo_col = mongo_db[mongo_collection]

# Function to perform OCR on an image
def perform_ocr(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    return text

# Function to compare OCR text with database
def compare_with_database(text):
    # Compare with SQL database
    cursor = sql_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM <TABLE_NAME> WHERE <COLUMN_NAME> = '{text}'")
    sql_result = cursor.fetchone()

    # Compare with MongoDB
    mongo_result = mongo_col.find_one({'<FIELD_NAME>': text})

    # Compare with Firebase
    firebase_result = firebase_db.collection(firebase_collection).where('<FIELD_NAME>', '==', text).get()

    # Return the results
    return sql_result, mongo_result, firebase_result

# Main code
image_path = '<PATH_TO_IMAGE_FILE>'
ocr_text = perform_ocr(image_path)
sql_result, mongo_result, firebase_result = compare_with_database(ocr_text)

# Check for matches
if sql_result or mongo_result or not firebase_result.empty:
    print('Match found!')
else:
    print('No match found.')
Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (<SQL_SERVER_NAME>, <DATABASE_NAME>, <USERNAME>, <PASSWORD>, <MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI>, <MONGODB_DATABASE>, <MONGODB_COLLECTION>, <PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>, <FIREBASE_COLLECTION_NAME>, <TABLE_NAME>, <COLUMN_NAME>, <FIELD_NAME>, <PATH_TO_IMAGE_FILE>) with the actual values specific to your setup and requirements.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as pyodbc, pymongo, firebase_admin, pytesseract, and Pillow (you can install them via pip). Additionally, you'll need to set up the Tesseract OCR engine on your system.

This code should help you get started with pulling data from a SQL database or Firebase CSV file, performing OCR on an image, and comparing it with other databases. Feel free to adapt and enhance the code as per your needs.

ok now on bulk image folder on local system and fire base so re rite the  code
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an updated version of the code that can handle bulk images from a local folder and Firebase:

python
Copy code
import os
import pyodbc
import pymongo
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# SQL Server Connection Details
sql_server = '<SQL_SERVER_NAME>'
database = '<DATABASE_NAME>'
username = '<USERNAME>'
password = '<PASSWORD>'

# MongoDB Connection Details
mongo_uri = '<MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI>'
mongo_database = '<MONGODB_DATABASE>'
mongo_collection = '<MONGODB_COLLECTION>'

# Firebase Service Account Details
firebase_credentials = '<PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>'
firebase_collection = '<FIREBASE_COLLECTION_NAME>'

# Set up Firebase credentials
cred = credentials.Certificate(firebase_credentials)
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
firebase_db = firestore.client()

# Connect to SQL Server
sql_connection = pyodbc.connect(f"DRIVER={{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}};"
                                 f"SERVER={sql_server};"
                                 f"DATABASE={database};"
                                 f"UID={username};"
                                 f"PWD={password}")

# Connect to MongoDB
mongo_client = pymongo.MongoClient(mongo_uri)
mongo_db = mongo_client[mongo_database]
mongo_col = mongo_db[mongo_collection]

# Function to perform OCR on an image
def perform_ocr(image_path):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    return text

# Function to compare OCR text with database
def compare_with_database(text):
    # Compare with SQL database
    cursor = sql_connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM <TABLE_NAME> WHERE <COLUMN_NAME> = '{text}'")
    sql_result = cursor.fetchone()

    # Compare with MongoDB
    mongo_result = mongo_col.find_one({'<FIELD_NAME>': text})

    # Compare with Firebase
    firebase_result = firebase_db.collection(firebase_collection).where('<FIELD_NAME>', '==', text).get()

    # Return the results
    return sql_result, mongo_result, firebase_result

# Main code
image_folder = '<PATH_TO_IMAGE_FOLDER>'
for image_file in os.listdir(image_folder):
    image_path = os.path.join(image_folder, image_file)
    ocr_text = perform_ocr(image_path)
    sql_result, mongo_result, firebase_result = compare_with_database(ocr_text)

    # Check for matches
    if sql_result or mongo_result or not firebase_result.empty:
        print(f'Match found for image: {image_file}')
    else:
        print(f'No match found for image: {image_file}')
Similar to the previous code, you'll need to replace the placeholder values (<SQL_SERVER_NAME>, <DATABASE_NAME>, <USERNAME>, <PASSWORD>, <MONGODB_CONNECTION_URI>, <MONGODB_DATABASE>, <MONGODB_COLLECTION>, <PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>, <FIREBASE_COLLECTION_NAME>, <TABLE_NAME>, <COLUMN_NAME>, <FIELD_NAME>, <PATH_TO_IMAGE_FOLDER>) with the actual values specific to your setup and requirements.

Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as pyodbc, pymongo, firebase_admin, pytesseract, and Pillow (install them via pip if needed). Additionally, you'll need to set up the Tesseract OCR engine on your system.

This updated code should allow you to process multiple images from a local folder and compare the OCR text with the databases. Adjust the code further if necessary, depending on your specific needs.

ok now communicating betweeen same fire base folder data image got from two differnt codes running
ChatGPT
To communicate between two instances running the same Firebase folder and sharing data from images, you can use Firebase Realtime Database. Each instance can write data to a specific node in the database, and the other instances can listen for changes in that node to fetch the data.

Here's an example code that demonstrates how to communicate between two instances using Firebase Realtime Database:

Instance 1 (Code to write data to Firebase):

python
Copy code
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, db

# Firebase Service Account Details
firebase_credentials = '<PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>'
firebase_node = '<FIREBASE_NODE_NAME>'

# Set up Firebase credentials
cred = credentials.Certificate(firebase_credentials)
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {'databaseURL': 'https://<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>.firebaseio.com/'})
firebase_db = db.reference()

# Function to write data to Firebase
def write_data_to_firebase(image_file, data):
    firebase_db.child(firebase_node).child(image_file).set(data)

# Main code
image_file = 'image1.jpg'
data = 'Data to be shared'
write_data_to_firebase(image_file, data)
Instance 2 (Code to listen for data changes in Firebase):

python
Copy code
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, db

# Firebase Service Account Details
firebase_credentials = '<PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>'
firebase_node = '<FIREBASE_NODE_NAME>'

# Set up Firebase credentials
cred = credentials.Certificate(firebase_credentials)
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred, {'databaseURL': 'https://<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>.firebaseio.com/'})
firebase_db = db.reference()

# Function to listen for data changes in Firebase
def listen_for_data_changes(event):
    if event.event_type == 'child_added':
        image_file = event.path.split('/')[-1]
        data = event.data
        print(f"New data received for image '{image_file}': {data}")

# Main code
firebase_db.child(firebase_node).listen(listen_for_data_changes)
Ensure that you replace the placeholder values (<PATH_TO_FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_JSON>, <FIREBASE_NODE_NAME>, <YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>) with the appropriate values for your Firebase project.

Instance 1 is responsible for writing the data to the specified Firebase node. In this example, the data being shared is a simple string, but you can modify it to suit your needs.

Instance 2 listens for data changes in the same Firebase node and prints the new data whenever a new child is added to the node.

By running both instances simultaneously, you can establish communication between them through the Firebase Realtime Database, and any new data written by Instance 1 will be received and processed by Instance 2.

Remember to install the firebase_admin package using pip before running the code.

Feel free to modify the code as needed to fit your requirements and expand on the data structures and communication between the instances.
